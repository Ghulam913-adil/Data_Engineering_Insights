## üìñ Introduction

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing data stored in relational databases. This repository aims to provide examples and templates for creating efficient SQL queries and performing comprehensive data analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use the scripts and queries in this repository, you need to have a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Data-Analysis-and-SQL-Insights.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd Data-Analysis-and-SQL-Insights
   ```

### Sample Queries

Here are some example SQL queries included in this repository:

- **Query to retrieve all records from a table:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM table_name;
  ```

- **Query to find the total number of records in a table:**

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
  ```

- **Query to group records by a specific column and calculate the average value of another column:**

  ```sql
  SELECT column1, AVG(column2)
  FROM table_name
  GROUP BY column1;
  ```
