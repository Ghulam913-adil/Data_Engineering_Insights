## 📖 Introduction

Data Engineering involves designing, constructing, and maintaining scalable data pipelines. This repository provides an array of examples, templates, and best practices for building data workflows using modern technologies like Docker, Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, AWS, and Oracle databases. Whether you're building ETL processes, working with cloud services, or handling big data workloads, this repository aims to equip you with tools to succeed in Data Engineering.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Docker**: For containerizing applications and setting up isolated environments.
- **Apache Airflow**: For orchestrating data pipelines.
- **Apache Spark**: For large-scale data processing.
- **AWS Account**: To utilize cloud services for scalable solutions (e.g., S3, Redshift, RDS).
- **Oracle Database**: For enterprise-level data storage and management.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Data-Engineering-Insights.git
🚀 Sample Pipelines
Dockerized Spark Pipeline: Data processing with Apache Spark in Docker containers.

🐳 Spark: docker-compose up spark

ETL Pipeline in Airflow: Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) with Airflow.

🔄 Airflow: Orchestrating tasks in Python

AWS S3 Integration: Uploading data to AWS S3 bucket.

☁️ AWS: upload_to_s3('data.csv', 'my-s3-bucket')

Oracle Database Integration: Querying and inserting data into Oracle.

🏢 Oracle: connect_to_oracle()
